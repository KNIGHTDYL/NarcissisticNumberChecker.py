# NarcissisticNumberChecker.py

In number theory, a narcissistic number (also known as an Armstrong
number (after Michael F. Armstrong)) in a given number base b is
a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Examples of narcissistic numbers include:
43 (4^2 + 3^2 = 43)
153 (1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153)
9474 (9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4) = 9474)

36 is NOT a narcissistic number because 3^2 + 6^2 does not equal 36.
