In number theory, a narcissistic number (also known as an Armstrong
number (after Michael F. Armstrong)) in a given number base b is
a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Examples of narcissistic numbers include:
153 (1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153)

370 (3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3 = 370)

9474 (9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4) = 9474)

Note: 36 is NOT a narcissistic number because 3^2 + 6^2 does not equal 36.
